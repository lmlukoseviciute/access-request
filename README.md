# Access Request

Welcome! Nice to see you here!

This is a placeholder repository to request access to a private project.

If you are trying to access the [data analyses](https://github.com/lmlukoseviciute/TC) on [Everythin Data](https://lmlukoseviciute.github.io/EverythingData/), this analyses is private, in order to see it please ask for access. For all the private projects you will need to ask for access only once, so if you did that before (opened an Issue) no need to do it again.

## How to Request Access

Please follow these steps:

1. Click on the [**Issues** tab](https://github.com/lmlukoseviciute/access-request/issues).
2. Click on the green **“New issue”** button.
3. Use the title:  
   `Access request for data analyses`
4. In the issue description, include your **GitHub username**.
5. Submit the issue. You’ll receive an invitation once your request is approved.

## After Approval

Once invited, GitHub will notify you via email or dashboard. You must **accept the invitation** to gain access.
